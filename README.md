This project was started from the fantastic [MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust) repo, as a complementary crate for Key Vault REST API Bindings.

Given the success of Rust in general and this repository in particular, we at Microsoft decided it was due time to **migrate it in the [Microsoft Azure
](https://github.com/Azure) organization**. The new repo - still unofficial and unsupported - is here [https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust).

This repository have been made read-only for your convenience.
